# weekend-homework-12.1

This is a recreation of the Skinny Ties web site.  
I linked a page through the View our Story link.
I tried to put as many styling components as possible
in the master.css file.


I am still really struggling with positioning best practices
and completely failed at the sprite sheet exercise.  I do
not have photoshop and could not figure out how to use the
sprite editors that I found.
